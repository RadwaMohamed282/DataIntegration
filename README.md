# DataIntegration

  Overview
  
This project aims to integrate data from various sources into a unified system using .NET technologies. Three methods have been employed for data integration: API Integration, Message Queueing (RabbitMQ), and File System Integration (FTP and SFTP).

  Installation
  
- Ensure that you have .NET Core or .NET Framework installed on your system.
- Install necessary NuGet packages for each integration method.
- Set up RabbitMQ server if using Message Queueing.
- Ensure access to the FTP and SFTP servers for File System Integration.
  
  1. API Integration

- API integration involves retrieving data from external systems using their provided APIs.
- Utilize HttpClient class to interact with the APIs.
- Follow the API documentation provided by the external service to understand endpoints, authentication methods, and data formats.
- Implement error handling for cases like rate limiting, server errors, or invalid responses.
- Transform the retrieved data into a suitable format for further processing or storage.

  2. Message Queueing (RabbitMQ)
- Message Queueing facilitates asynchronous communication between different components of the system.
- Install and configure RabbitMQ client library for .NET.
- Define message queues and exchanges based on the data flow requirements.
- Producer applications publish messages to the designated exchanges.
- Consumer applications subscribe to the relevant queues to receive messages.
- Ensure message acknowledgment mechanisms to handle message delivery reliability.
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for processing failures.
- Monitor queue depths, message rates, and system health for efficient operation.
  
  3. File System Integration (FTP and SFTP)
     
- File System Integration involves transferring files between the local system and remote servers using FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).
- Utilize libraries such as FluentFTP for FTP and SSH.NET for SFTP in .NET for programmatic file transfer.
- Implement error handling for cases like connection failures, authentication errors, or file transfer errors.
- Secure file transfer by encrypting data when using SFTP.
- Monitor file transfer status, logs, and system resources to ensure smooth operation.
